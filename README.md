# My Personal Project

## What will the application do?

This application will allow users to maintain an agenda consisting of sticky
notes that sync automatically with a calendar (and vice versa). It can be used 
by anyone who wishes to stay organized and increase their productivity by 
compartmentalizing their daily tasks and keeping track of due dates. This would
be particularly useful for students who are often studying multiple subjects
in a year / semester, but it could be useful to anyone wishing to break down
their life into multiple working areas. This project interests me because I use
stickies as my primary agenda and I would like to be able to synchronize them to a
calendar.

An example of text with **bold** and *italic* fonts.  Note that the IntelliJ markdown previewer doesn't seem to render 
the bold and italic fonts correctly but they will appear correctly on GitHub.
